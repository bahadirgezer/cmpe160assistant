this project did not have any output files so syntax errors can be a major problem when testing your code.

you can use this validity checker to check if you have any typos or unnecessary syntax errors in your code. 

you can run the executable with two command line arguemnts. The first should be the input file, and the next should be the special output log for that input file.

The validity checker output log is different from the normal output log. For the validity checker output log you should append "= <profit>" to each line. <profit> is the change in profit for that output log line.

By default the validity checker outputs a status for every line. You can disable this and make it so that only wrong lines are outputted if you give the third command line arguments as 1.
