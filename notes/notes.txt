why planes don't fly faster

plane speed.

plane seat arrangement

economy, premium economy to buiness to first class

faster planes, different fuel economies.

3 different plane types.
Fast -> concorde
Big -> A380
Standart -> 737
Small -> propeller


make you choose the types of planes,

ways to compete?



month to month, day to day for one year.

schedule

steady input stream of passenger, the input will be just passengers and cargo and their information.

where they want to go.
The money they're willing to spend.
If you can't get them to where they want to go they'll pay you less.

There will be a function of how much they're willing to spend.

The revenue will come when 

Need to keep track of planes, their fullness, max number of planes,



output will be a log of your actions. And then the total revenue



airline.aircraft -> will have square footage. The student will have to decide on how much of each class to utilise. Will have id?
Passenger:
    Jet,
    Rapid, 
    Widebody,
    Prop,
Cargo:
    Heavy,
    Widebody,
    Prop,

Both:
    Widebody,

no range -> weight and fuel load will determine the range.

will need to incentivize small airline.aircraft usage for small destinations.


Will be able to choose what kind of airline they will be (need to model that) 

budget, domestic focused, international focused etc.



The seat configuration of the plane will be decided by the student.

Which plane with which configuration will fly between which routes will be decided
by the student.

Interface -> to generalize the class and subclasses

Abstract class is to add parent fields



Main -> Airport list
Main -> Airplane list

Airport -> Passenger list / cargo
Airplane -> Passenger list / cargo


Airline -> Aircraft list -> Passenger list / cargo + currentAirport
Main -> Airports


HashMap<Passenger>
HashMap<Cargo>

airline.aircraft


get a certain percentage of price payed from the passenger
